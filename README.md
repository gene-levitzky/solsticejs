Project Solstice
=================  
  
Installation requirements:  
---------------------------

* [Node.js](http://nodejs.org/) (for javascript web application)  
* [Git](http://msysgit.github.io/)     (for code subversion control)  
(More to come!)  
  
  
Suggested Tools:
---------------------

* [Notepad++](http://notepad-plus-plus.org/) (for editing javascript, html, css, etc)
* [AppFog](https://www.appfog.com/)    (for actually hosting our site, it's free but we don't get a fancy domain)
  
  
Preliminary Instructions
------------------------

Once you download and install git, you can run the .exe and run the following command:
> clone git://github.com/gene-levitzky/solstice.git  
  
Or you can run it from your command prompt by doing:
> git clone git://github.com/gene-levitzky/solstice.git

*I'll update this when I think of more stuff, but getting familiar Node and Git is the most important thing for now.*
